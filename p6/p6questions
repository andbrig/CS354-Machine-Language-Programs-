Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

-----------------------------------------
./intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:20 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:23 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:26 2016
^C
----------------------------------------

Q: How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statement?

	The main function of intdate.c is able to come out of the infinite while loop because of signals.
Signals are very much like exceptions in that they stop the flow of execution to handle the signal.
An infinite loop is part of the flow of execution, so it can be stopped to handle the signal, then return
to running infinitely. Of course our program gets around this indefinitely running by calling exit(0) in 
the signal handler.
